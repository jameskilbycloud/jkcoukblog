# Running Nutanix CE at Home: AHV Setup & First Impressions

By[James Kilby](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2018 · Updated June 1, 2026 • 📖1 min read(191 words)

I ran a Nutanix CE server at home for a little while when it first came out. However, due to the fairly high requirements, it didn’t make sense to me to continue running it at home. This was compounded by the fact that I have many clusters to play with at work. These all run my Hypervisor of choice vSphere so I thought it was about time to see what was new with AHV and Nutanix CE….

I downloaded the latest copy of CE from the Nutanix site and extracted it to a USB stick with [Rufus.](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) (This took about 30 mins)

The server that I chose to run this on was the same server I ran initially, a Dell T20 with the Xeon processor 32GB of RAM 1x240GB SSD and 1x3TB WD Red. The installation is pretty straightforward and is covered a lot elsewhere.

I am just kicking the tyres with it at the moment and running a few VMs. I have also shared the storage from my Nutanix CE setup back to my vSphere environment.

I’ll post back with some updates of what I get up to with it
