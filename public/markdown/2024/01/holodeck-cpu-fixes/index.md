# VMware Holodeck on Older CPUs: Fixing Compatibility Issues

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 18, 2024 · Updated June 1, 2026 • 📖1 min read(268 words)

Disclaimer: This is **not** a supported configuration by the Holodeck team, please don’t reach out to them for help. No support will be given for running CPUs without the required feature sets.

## Table of Contents

In my [previous post](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/01/multihost-holodeck-vcf/) about my Holodeck experience, I mentioned that I had some issues due to the age of the physical CPUs in the hosts that I was using to run Holodeck. This error will manifest itself in three places during the deployment.

  * Nested ESX Power On
  * vCLS machine deployment
  * NSX Edge deployment

## Nested ESX Power On

Obviously, my CPUs are not supported for ESXi 8.0.1 and when the host is powered on you will see the image below. 

![ESXi unsupported error](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-27-at-12.55.09.png)

Just like with a physical host, it is possible to override this. 

This is done by adding 
    
    
    --ignoreprereqwarnings --ignoreprereqerrors --forceunsupportedinstall

📋 Copy

to the VLCGUI.ps1 script.

For the same reasons when the cluster is built and the vCLS VMs for DRS are deployed, they will fail to power on. 

## NSX Edge

![Holodeck CPU Fixes Screenshot](https://jameskilby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-02-at-14.28.25.png)

And last of all when the NSX edges attempt to power on they will fail due to the lack of a feature in the CPU called 1G huge page support. These issues can manifest when deploying NSX outside of VCF so a lot has been written about these issues and how to overcome them.

## Solution

Luckily, a colleague of mine, Tim Sommer, has made all of the required changes to the VLCGUI.ps1 deployment script and that is available [here ](https://ent.box.com/s/u4wiwh2mq8o05ct8e67ndapvxhudkhe2)

I have tried this multiple times and I have had a 100% success rate with the deployment with no manual fixes being required.
