# Configure DHCP Option 43 for UniFi devices to enable remote adoption across subnets

## Intro

This guide shows how to configure DHCP Option 43 so UniFi devices can be adopted remotely across subnets. I have recently juggled some of my homelab services around, which involved moving my UniFi server to a different subnet. This meant that new UniFi devices could not find the UniFi server for adoption/control purposes as this is usually done with broadcast. This was part of my wider [home network upgrade](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/09/home-network-upgrade/).

## Layer 3 Adoption Options

For Remote Adoption/Layer 3 UniFi supports:

  * SSH
  * DNS
  * DHCP Option 43

I discounted SSH as who wants to manually log into things and make changes and I discounted DNS. That left me with DHCP Option 43.

## Configuring DHCP Option 43

I decided to configure my DHCP server to hand out “option 43” on the network subnet the Access Points were connected to. The implementation of this will differ depending on what DHCP server you are using. Mine is the one built into my WatchGuard Firebox M200.

In this, I have set a custom option and then it asks for four values:

Code| 43  
---|---  
Name | Unifi  
Type | Hexadecimal  
Value | 01:04:c0:a8:14:02  
  
All of which are straightforward except the last one so let me explain. It is made up of 2 parts…

The first two parts 01:04 are fixed for UniFi. I am hosting the controller on IP 192.168.20.2. The remaining part of the value (c0:a8:14:02) is the IP address of the UniFi controller in Hex. Please note this method does not support DNS.

A multitude of tools exist for converting IP to HEX one can be found [here](https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-hex)

And there you have it. I can connect a factory fresh UniFi device to my network. DHCP will hand out an IP on one subnet and tell the device how to reach the controller in a different subnet.
