# My First Homelab Storage Setup: HP Gen8 & Xpenology

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2018 · Updated June 1, 2026 • 📖1 min read(197 words)

I have been meaning to post around some of the lab setup for a while. Although it changes frequently at present it’s as below. I will add some pics when I have tidied up the lab/cables….

My primary lab storage is all contained within an HP Gen8 Microserver.

Currently Configured:

1x INTEL Core i3-4130 running at 2.3Ghz

16Gb of RAM

4x 1Gb/s NIC

2x 3TB WD Red

2x Intel SSD 320 Series 80GB, 25nm MLC

This is running Xpenology.

I have the 4 Nics split into two LACP bonds. One for the management traffic and one for pure NFS traffic.

The 2x WD Reds are in an SHR configuration with the SSDs running as an SSD read-write cache.

This gives me 2.6TB useable which is plenty to lab and store photos and media and with the RW cache, the perf is pretty damn good.

I also have a DS216+II Synology with 2x 2TB WD Red’s this is my tier 2 lab storage, for backups ISO’s etc

I am running a few apps/containers on the Xpenology install as it has a lot more ram/processing power.

At the moment this consists of:

Docker – GitLab

Docker – PHPipam

Plex

Yes, that’s a clickbait title. But technically it’s possible if I dropped all drive redundancy… I recently saw an advert for a server that was just too good to be true.
