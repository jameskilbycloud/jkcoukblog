This is a single page intended to collate every single feature of the current [VMware Cloud on AWS hosts](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/cloud/vmware-cloud-on-aws/SaaS/operations-guide/managing-sddc-hosts-and-clusters/vmware-cloud-on-aws-host-types.html) for easy comparison.

All of this data is publicly available. I have just collated it into a single page.. For more on running VMware Cloud on AWS, see my post on [Time Sync in a VMC environment](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2025/12/time-in-a-vmc-environment/).
