# Home Network Upgrade to 25Gb/s with MikroTik Switching

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) September 9, 2024 · Updated June 5, 2026 • 📖2 min read(475 words)

I have recently moved over to Mikrotik Switching for all of my Home environment as part of my home network upgrade. What started life as a move away from gigabit networking had some serious scope creep. As I needed new switches, network adaptors and cabling I evaluated the obvious choice of just upgrading to 10Gb/s. However, when looking at the price comparison to upgrade to 25Gb/s I felt the cost uplift was justified and certainly better future-proofed. This became the baseline for the majority of my server workloads. The Access switch layer has basically stayed gigabit but with 10Gb/s uplinks. This followed on from my recent [homelab compute upgrade](https://jameskilby.co.uk/2024/07/new-nodes/).

## Why I Did This Home Network Upgrade

The decision to go to Mikrotik was predominantly based on the huge performance available for limited costs. So far I have been impressed with the switches once I got over the initial steep learning curve of RouterOS. I have purchased several switches spread out over a few months. This coincided with a property move so some extras were bought to accommodate the new layout. In the property, my lab was relocated to a dedicated space and I also wanted wired connectivity into my office.

## Switches Purchased

Number| Model| £Price | Function| OS  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| [CRS504_4XQ](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs504_4xq_in)| 704.40| Core Switch| RouterOS  
1|   
[CRS305-1G-4S+IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs305_1g_4s_in)| 131.15| Breakout Switch| RouterOS  
2| [CSS610-8P-2S+IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/css610_8p_2s_in)| 193.46| House and Office Switch| SwitchOS Lite  
1|   
[CSS610-8G-2S+](https://mikrotik.com/product/css610_8g_2s_in)| 183.87| OOB Switch| SwitchOS Lite  
Total| | 1406.34| |   
  
The 100Gb/s Switch is effectively my core switch. It only has 4 physical ports however each of these can be split into 4x25gb/s or slower ports if needed. In the current state all 4 ports are used, however I do have 3 remaining breakouts available if needed.

I have then used the 5-Port 10 Gb/s switch sort of as a media translator for connections to the access switches around the house with 10Gb uplinks to distribute the network around the home and present ethernet ports to my devices.

## Configuring the MikroTik Switches

Mikrotik Switches can typically run one of two operating systems either RouterOS or SwitchOS. (The 3 ethernet port switches will only run SwOS)

SwitchOS is a much simpler setup and is similar to a web-managed switch from other manufacturers. It’s a trivial setup for anyone that’s used a web-managed switch before. 

The config for these switches takes a little bit of time to get familiar with as they are incredibly powerful. It’s possible to run RouterOS or SwitchOS on them however I could never get SwitchOS to boot correctly on the 100Gb/s switch so I stuck with RouterOS and persevered through the config. Part 2 will go into my RouterOS setup.

I have a draft post of the steps I have used to get RouterOS configured how I like. I will try and finish that off when I get some more time.
