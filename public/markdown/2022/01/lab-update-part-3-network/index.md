# Homelab Network Upgrade: DACs, 40Gb/s vMotion & pfSense

By[James](https://jameskilby.co.uk) January 6, 2022 · Updated May 31, 2026 • 📖1 min read(113 words)

I have retired the WatchGuard Devices with the migration to PFSense running bare-metal in one of the Supermicro Nodes. I will likely virtualise this in the future.

In terms of network/switching I have moved to an intermediate step here. vMotion and Storage are running over DAC’s while VMware management and VM traffic is still over 1Gb/s networking. This is working incredibly well. Due to the onboard network cards I am able to vMotion at 40Gb/s which for a home lab is game-changing. Storage is currently over 25Gb/s and the long-term plan is to get a 25Gb/s switch. The contenders at the moment are a Used Dell enterprise switch or possibly a QNAP box.
